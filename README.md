Challenge 1 for Jacob Davis
In this challenge I reorganized the html and CSS code and added comments and alt tags to images.
In the html I replaced the divs with semantic tags and removed unnecessary class and id tags.
In the CSS I combined several classes together into more generalizable classes and organized the order of the CSS file.
